Q.1 Write a program to add, subtract and multiply two complex numbers using structures to function.

Q.2 Write a program by creating an 'Strudent' Structure and ‘Scores’ Structure with following methods :-

Student
[name : String ; roll_no : Int ; scoreOfEachSubject : Score ;  department : String, School : String ]

Score
[Hindi, English, Maths, Science]

1. new()  :- To initialize Student objects.

2. get_average() :- To get average of all scores.

3. pass_student() :- Add numbers to student’s subject score if score is less than 35.
                 Eg. Suppose a student's maths score is 31, Hindi score is 24. Then this function will automatically add 4 numbers (To make it 35) to maths score and 11 numbers to Hindi score (To make it 35).

4. compare_student(Argument : Another Student)  => Print difference of each subject’s score.
